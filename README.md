Expense Tracker
===============

Creates and analyzes expenses per category. The main class to run the program is MainMenu, and it requires all of the following files to run:

* Analysis
* AnalysisMenu
* Archive
* Category
* ExpenseTraits

AdditionalExpenses is an optional extension of the MainMenu class. It currently adds a "moving expense" category.
